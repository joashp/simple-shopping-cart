<h1>Simple Shopping Cart in PHP (E-Commerce Website)</h1>

The website shopping system was using the internet as the sole method for selling goods to its consumers. It would allow customers to register with the site and purchase goods online. Using sessions and cookies to save users, users can add and purchase products. Various products where displayed through a database, where the user could place the order. Payment gateway mechanism was provided and a system administrator to update the database.

This is not pretty site, nor I am pround of it. But this was my first website project. I had done this side project in my third year of engineering.
